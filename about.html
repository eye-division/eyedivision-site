  <p class="strapline">Alun Ward started <strong>Eye Division</strong> in 2005,  after ten years in the industry, to build websites for artists. Since then he's been helping artists, arts organisations, businesses, charities and universities and research programmes find their way on the web.</p>
  <p>Eye Division provides design and web development expertise, and can call on a network of local suppliers for content writing, photography and video, branding and marketing support.</p>
