Every summer in September artists and designer makers open their doors to the public in the **Herts Visual Arts Festival** Open Studios.   

We re-built their website using Drupal and our own Open Studios framework to allow staff and artists to manage their listings and images. We added mapping to their existing website.  

We fully manage the site, providing year-round support to keep the site running smoothly and securely.
