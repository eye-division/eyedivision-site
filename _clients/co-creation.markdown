**Co-Creation** is a new 4-year EU-funded project that aims to bring together different actors, such as researchers, policymakers, residents and artists, to ‘co-create’ understanding about different urban neighbourhoods and to address disadvantage. We worked with Flora Hands at Carline once again to incorporate new branding into this project website. Content will grow over the years, and we continue to support and host the site.  

##Features include:

* WordPress based site allowing page and blog updates by staff
* Worked with Carline Creative on the design and branding
