**Bucks Art Weeks 2024** will be taking place throughout the county from 8 to 23 June 2024.

We re-built their website using Drupal and our own Open Studios framework to allow staff and artists to manage their listings and images. We took the opportunity to integrate their new print design into the website, and make it responsive, highlighting some of the stunning images produced by the artists.

We fully manage the site, providing year-round support to keep the site running smoothly and securely.
