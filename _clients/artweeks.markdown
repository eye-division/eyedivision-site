**Oxfordshire Artweeks** is the UK’s oldest and largest open studio event.  We have a long-standing relationship with Artweeks, and Alun has exhibited with them several times. We first re-built Artweeks’ website in 2011 and continue to manage, develop and support the service.  The site allows over 700 artists exhibiting at almost 500 venues to manage and pay for their exhibition entries online.  

##Features include:

* Comprehensive entry and membership forms for artists
* Integrated with PayPal to allow eCommerce
* Event listings sorted by date, location and tag
* Search by tags (media, region, etc.) as well as free text searching
* Comprehensive back-office functions, including additional search facilities and ability to export data (e.g. to spreadsheet)
