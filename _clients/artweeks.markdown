From 6th-29th May 2023 you can feast your eyes on a huge range of creative activity by hundreds of artists, makers and designers in artists' studios, pop-up galleries, glorious gardens, ancient churches, medieval tithe barns and hundreds of other amazing venues.

**Oxfordshire Artweeks** is the UK’s oldest and largest open studio event.  We have a long-standing relationship with Artweeks, and Alun has exhibited with them several times. We first re-built Artweeks’ website in 2011 and continue to manage, develop and support the service.  The site allows over 700 artists exhibiting at almost 500 venues to manage and pay for their exhibition entries online.
