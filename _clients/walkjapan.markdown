>Alun and Neil have been a key team in developing, managing and maintaining resource websites for Walk Japan brand. Eye Division team is not only pleasurable team-mates to work with, they are technically proficient, friendly, punctual and responsible which are often hard to find. Whenever any issues arose, they were always on hand to rescue us very quickly. I am glad that we could build a trust and hope to continue our great working relationship with the team!
