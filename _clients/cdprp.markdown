Eye Division worked with Fee Chandler of Sparkling Communications to produce a new site for the **The Centre for Diversity Policy Research and Practice** at Oxford Brookes University. We helped restructure existing content, source imagery and style the pages using the latest in-house branding guidelines from the web team at Oxford Brookes University.
