The **Commercial Services** Department at Oxford Brookes Business School was looking for a new site, to fit in with the newer university branding and help promote their services to the business sector. Working with Sparkling Communications we worked on the site architecture, built the site and assembled all the content ready for release.

##Features include:

* publication of pages within the in-house *Ektron* content management system
