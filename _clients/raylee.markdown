testimonial_markdown: It’s been great to work with Alun from Eye Division on my new website. I’m very happy with the end result and the process of designing and building the site and then talking me through the updating process has been very efficient and painless!

**Ray Lee** is an award-winning sound artist and composer. He creates spinning, whirling, and pendulous sound installations and performances that explore "circles of ether", the invisible forces that surround us.  

We built the site in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and opened up a simple editing system for Ray so he can continue to update his site on his own time.
