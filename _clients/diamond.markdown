**Diamond Light Source** is the UKâ€™s national synchrotron science facility, located at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire.  

We designed five HTML5 web based interactive animations explaining some of the processes involved in the synchrotron. The Undulator, the Dipole Magnet, the Electron Gun, residual particles and the Linac. Much use was made of CreateJS and Greensock's GSAP library.
