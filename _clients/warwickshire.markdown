This summer from June 18 to July 3 artists and designer makers open their doors to the public in <strong>Warwickshire Open Studios</strong>. Over 250 artists in over 200 venues showing unique and fascinating work, where visitors have the chance to talk to the artists, see how the work is made and even have a go themselves. Entry to every venue is free.

Eye Division re-built their website to allow staff and artists to manage their listings and images. We took the opportunity to integrate their new print design into the website, and make it responsive, highlighting some of the stunning images produced by the artists.

We fully manage the site, providing year-round support to keep the site running smoothly and securely.
