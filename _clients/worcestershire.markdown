**Worcestershire Open Studios** 2023 ran over 10 days from Saturday 19 August to Monday 28 August.

Our newest Open Studios, Eye Division re-built the existing website in 2022 using our custom Drupal framework to allow artists to register for the event, pay for their entries online, and for staff to manage their listings and images.

We fully manage the site, providing year-round support to keep the site running smoothly and securely in Drupal.
