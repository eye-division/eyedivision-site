**Confront Eugenics** serves as a unifying platform for various anti-eugenic activities. It aims to consolidate synergies among scholars of eugenics, activists, practitioners, journalists, curators and artists across the world and aspires to build conceptual bridges across academic disciplines and to mobilize communities, while at the same time facilitating public engagement with the history and legacies of eugenics.
