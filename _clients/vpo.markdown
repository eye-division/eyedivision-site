testimonial_markdown: As a new project office at Oxford Brookes the VPO wanted to develop a website for project management guidance and information to support the evolving network of project managers across the organisation. We were keen that the site should be user friendly and based around a graphic interface for the main project toolkit. Alun worked with us to understand what we needed and the community of people it was aimed at. He and Eye Division did a fantastic job of translating our vision into reality and the results were very well received by our users.
