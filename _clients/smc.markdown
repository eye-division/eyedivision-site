The **Sussex Mindfulness Centre** (SMC) brings together teachers, trainers and researchers of Mindfulness-based Approaches (MBAs) in Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT). With 40 members of staff they have been offering mindfulness training since 2011.

In 2023 we worked with the Centre and designer <a href="https://davidcaines.co.uk/design">David Caines</a> to migrate the site to the WordPress content management system and revisit the original design.


##Features include:

* Branding to align with revised NHS central branding guidelines
* Sourcing photographs for the website
* Integration with Eventbrite for event listings and booking
* Fully editable pages for internal staff
