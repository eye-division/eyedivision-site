The **Sussex Mindfulness Centre** (SMC) brings together teachers, trainers and researchers of Mindfulness-based Approaches (MBAs) in Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT). With 40 members of staff they have been offering mindfulness training since 2011. We worked with the team to re-structure their content and train them in the new editing system. On the technical side, we developed the site as a Jekyll based static solution, but with safe and secure editing made possible by using Cloudcannon.  


##Features include:

* Branding to align with revised NHS central branding guidelines
* Sourcing photographs for the website
* Integration with Eventbrite for event listings and booking
* Fully editable pages for internal staff
