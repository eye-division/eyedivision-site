The <strong>Healthy Urban Mobility</strong> (HUM) project is a study to understand the impact of everyday (im)mobility on health and wellbeing with a variety of social groups living in different neighbourhoods in Brazil and the UK, and also to explore the potential for participatory mobilities planning with local communities to support and develop solutions for healthy urban mobility.

Eye Division built a dual-language site in English and Portuguese using the Genesis framework for WordPress for the team to keep the site updated with the research as it progresses. We continue to provide hosting and support the site, ensuring site security and responding to support requests during the lifetime of the project.
