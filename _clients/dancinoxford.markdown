We moved the **Dancin' Oxford** web site over to our content management system, building a responsive site which allows staff to update and add new content easily.  
**Dancinâ€™ Oxford** coordinate an annual festival of dance in the spring, and organise dance events throughout the year.  
With the support of Oxford City Council and its Dance Officer, it involves a successful and well co-ordinated partnership working between key organisations in the city of Oxford. Festival partners are Pegasus Theatre, Oxford Playhouse, Oxford City Council and Oxford Castle.
