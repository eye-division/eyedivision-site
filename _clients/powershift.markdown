testimonial_markdown: In just a few short months, DoubleXEconomy had to build a brand new site for our annual forum, and produce a comprehensive re-launch of our company website.  Eye Divisionâ€™s support for both projects has been invaluable, and the response from our community has been extremely positive. We can depend on Alun and Neil to help execute our vision.

Now in its fifth year, **The Power Shift Forum** for Women in the World Economy, founded by Professor Linda Scott, takes place in Washington D.C..  

Eye Division built the site and is proud to be working with Double X Economy and the Power Shift team to support their site throughout the event and beyond.
  
The invitation-only **Power Shift Forum** brings together leaders from the private sector, public sector, and civil society, in order to assemble a high-level and engaged group of participants committed to better inclusion of women in the world economy. The Power Shift Forum for Women in the World Economy is an annual symposium where like-minded leaders meet to discuss women as economic actors in the global marketplace.
