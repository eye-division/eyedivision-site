**Fete Dat** is a creative production company producing arts, cultural and heritage projects across the UK. Led by Ameneh Enayat and Rosemary Richards, Fete Day works with arts producers and heritage professionals to create outstanding and innovative projects and events including festivals, outdoor performances, exhibitions, media projects and community participation.   

We built the site in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and opened up a simple editing system for the team to keep their site up to date.
