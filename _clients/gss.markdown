>Working with Eye Division has been a pleasure. They helped us to understand more fully what we were looking for from our website, and then to make it happen. Support has been seamless and effective throughout - I'm more than happy to recommend them in the most positive terms.
David Valler, Global Science Spaces

<p><strong>Global Science Spaces</strong> is the website for a new international network examining the diversity of global science spaces as hybrid physical, political-ideological and cultural forms. We worked with designers <a href="http://www.carlinecreative.co.uk">Carline Creative</a> to design the site, built it in WordPress, and provide ongoing support.</p>
