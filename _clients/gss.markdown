  Working with Eye Division has been a pleasure. They helped us to understand
  more fully what we were looking for from our website, and then to make it
  happen. Support has been seamless and effective throughout - Iâ€™m more than
  happy to recommend them in the most positive terms.

**Global Science Spaces** was a website for a new international network examining the diversity of global science spaces as hybrid physical, political-ideological and cultural forms. We worked with designers [Carline Creative](http://www.carlinecreative.co.uk) to brand the site, built it in WordPress, support the hosting and now provide ongoing support.
