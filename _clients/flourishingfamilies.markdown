The **Flourishing Families Clinic** is a totally new innovation in the NHS, piloted by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. It's a specialist clinic, based in adult mental health services, that supports parents seeking treatment for mild to moderate mental health difficulties.

Eye Division built a customer-maintained site in Jekyll, supplying training and ongoing support, built to the required AA accessibility standards.
