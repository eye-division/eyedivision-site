The **Journal of Jewish Studies** is an internationally renowned, peer-reviewed academic journal for the promotion of research into all aspects of Jewish studies.  

Working with Lucy Morton, the Journal's designer and Richard Buckner, the Journal's developer, we produced this responsive revision of the main JJS site.
