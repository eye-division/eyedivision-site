**cycle BOOM** was a study co-ordinated from Oxford Brookes University to understand cycling among the older population and how this affects independence, health and wellbeing.  
We worked with designers (Carline Creative)[http://www.carlinecreative.co.uk]who produced the branding, and we built it into a WordPress site.
